# Analyze the New York Subway System

### Project Description
In this project I will be analyizing MTA New York City Subway data taken from the month of May in the year 2011. This MTA data contains hourly entries and exits to turnstiles in the subway system. I have also joined weather information gathered from Weather Underground containing features such as temperature, barometric pressure, indicators for rain, fog, thunder, the total amount of precipitation, among others.

### Question 
I worked on this data subset to draw an interesting conclusion about the dataset itself with the key question of: Do more people ride the subway when it is raining versus when it is not raining.
