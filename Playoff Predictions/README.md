# Playoff Predictions

### Description 
In this project we can analyze Baseball Data perform exploratory data analysis and determine the factors that influence playoff apprearances and eventually predict statistics to influence playoff appearances. 

This project is especially important to me as I have played baseball my entire life, played in high school, played in college at UC Berkeley, and I am a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan. So this data and project is close to my heart.

### Data Origin 
The data comes from the Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database. We can download the zipfile from the internet and unzip it and extract the files we desire.
