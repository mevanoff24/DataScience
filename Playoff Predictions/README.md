# Playoff Predictions

In this project we can analyze Baseball Data perform exploratory data analysis and and eventually predict statistics to influence playoff appearances. This project is especially important to me as I have played baseball my entire life, played in high school, played at UC Berkeley in college, and am a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan. So this data and project is close to my heart.

The data comes from the Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database. We can download the zipfile from the internet and unzip it and extract the files we desire.
