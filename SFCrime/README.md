# San Francisco Crime

### Project Details
Exploratory Data Analysis and Predicting the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay
From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.

Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.

From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location, you must predict the category of crime that occurred.
What can we learn about the city through visualizations?

### Project Info
San Francisco Crime Classification - Kaggle Competition - Exploratory Data Analysis and Predicting the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay from 1934 to 1963. At the time of completing the machine learning model created placed 72nd of 1000+ applicants on Kaggle. In this project we plot the location and time intervals of crimes, discover police district most involved in the arrests, discover interesting facts about the data, and lastly use advanced machine learning techniques to predict the crime category. The most fun and best learning experience was from creating beautiful and meaningful visualizations; using maps, line plots, word clouds, etc.  Most difficult part was feature creation as it was a dataset with only  6 usable columns and we needed to find better predictors for the problem.
